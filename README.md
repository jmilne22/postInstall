postInstall
===========

A post install script I've created to add repositories, update the system and install the applications I need on Ubuntu.

As of now it:

1. Adds respositories
2. Updates and upgrades the system
3. Installs Applications specified
4. Installs restricted extras.

You can edit this script to suit your needs.
